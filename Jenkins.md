# Jenkins

Problem - Merged but not Integrted

Developers keep merging code VCS several times in a day. All the code collected from different developers creates conflicts and bugs. 

Solution - build code from VCS after every commmit - CONTINUOUS INEGRATION. 

Continuous Integration Process - Dev - VCS - Fetch - Build - Test - Notify Dev
